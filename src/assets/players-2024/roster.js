    bio: "Alisson Becker has cemented his position as one of world football's most formidable goalkeepers since joining Liverpool FC in 2018. He arrived at Anfield from AS Roma and was integral to the Champions League and Premier League triumphs in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The Brazilian enjoyed an incredible first season on Merseyside after becoming an immediate starter for the Reds, initially wearing the No.13 shirt. Alisson played every minute of the domestic campaign and made history when he became the club's first goalkeeper to win the Premier League Golden Glove award in more than a decade after recording 21 clean sheets en route to a second-placed finish with 97 points. The stopper was also crucial in helping Liverpool win the Champions League for the sixth time. He preserved the Reds' spot in the knockout stages of the 2018-19 competition with a crucial late save against Napoli on matchday six. And Alisson was then impenetrable in the Madrid final, making a series of interventions to deny Tottenham Hotspur as Jürgen Klopp's men won 2-0. Having lifted the Copa America with his country that summer, he switched from No.13 to No.1 at the start of the 2019-20 club campaign. Though an injury on the opening night of the new league season ruled the 'keeper out for two months, he soon returned to trademark form. Alisson – who was also part of the team crowned world champions in December 2019 – registered 13 clean sheets in 29 appearances to help Liverpool race to Premier League glory with a club-record 99 points. He provided the most unforgettable moment of a challenging 2020-21 campaign when he scored a stoppage-time, headed winner at West Bromwich Albion that was vital to the Reds securing Champions League qualification. A new long-term contract and another outstanding season followed as Alisson featured in 54 of Liverpool's 63 games as they lifted the FA Cup and League Cup as well as finishing runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League. The 'keeper, who saved a penalty in the FA Cup final shootout against Chelsea at Wembley, also added a second Premier League Golden Glove to his personal honours. Alisson passed 200 appearances for the club in 2022-23 and his excellent personal form, across a difficult campaign collectively, earned him the Men's Player of the Season award."

    bio:"Goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili officially became a Liverpool player in July 2025. The Reds had agreed a deal with Valencia to sign the highly rated Georgia international the previous summer. He arrived on Merseyside following four seasons in Spain and 134 appearances between the posts for Los Che. Mamardashvili made his debut for Georgia a few months into his Valencia career, in a friendly with Bulgaria back in September 2021. He has since become a key figure for his country and starred at the 2024 European Championship with 21 saves in the group stage, the joint-most by any 'keeper in the competition's history. Born in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital city, Mamardashvili began his career in the youth set-up of FC Gagra ahead of a move to Dinamo Tbilisi. Although unable to break through at Dinamo, he received invaluable senior experience during a pair of loan spells at FC Rustavi and then Locomotive Tbilisi. Having been named Georgian Goalkeeper of the Year in 2020, Mamardashvili's development caught the eye of Valencia, who acquired his services in the build-up to 2021-22 on a loan deal that soon became permanent. The goalkeeper was quickly thrust into La Liga action and recorded a clean sheet on his competitive debut in a 1-0 win at home to Getafe. Mamardashvili's first season at the club involved a run to the Copa Del Rey final, in which he started the penalty shootout defeat by Real Betis. The starting job was his permanently in the second term with Valencia and he held onto it for the remainder of his time there. In February 2024, Mamardashvili broke the Valencia record for most consecutive La Liga outings as a goalkeeper, surpassing club icon Jose Manuel Ochotorena's previous high of 59. He ended 2023-24 having registered 13 clean sheets in the top flight, setting a new benchmark at the club. His rise received recognition with a nomination for the 2024 Yachine Trophy, given to the world's best men's goalkeeper, alongside nine of his peers, and he finished seventh in the voting. He was, however, named Georgian Footballer of the Year for 2024 two months later, ending Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's firm grip on that honour. Taking the next step in his career, Mamardashvili signed a long-term contract with Liverpool to join the goalkeeping department ahead of 2025-26."

    bio:"Freddie Woodman arrived at Liverpool in the summer of 2025 to bolster the goalkeeping department. The experienced stopper joined the Reds on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract with Preston North End. Woodman spent three seasons at Deepdale after signing from Newcastle United and made 138 appearances between the posts in all competitions.  Born in London to father Andy, a former professional goalkeeper himself, Freddie began his footballing journey in Crystal Palace's ranks before heading to Newcastle in 2013. He had six loan spells during his Newcastle career – at Hartlepool United, Crawley Town, Kilmarnock, Aberdeen, Swansea City and AFC Bournemouth – but made nine senior outings as a Magpie, four of which came in the Premier League. Woodman left St. James' Park for Preston in the summer of 2022 and won the Championship club's Player of the Year award in his first season there.  He represented England at youth level all the way through to the U21s set-up, and was part of the Young Lions teams that won the U17 European Championship in 2014 and U20 World Cup in 2017, earning the Golden Glove prize in the latter."

    bio:"Virgil van Dijk has established himself as one of the finest defenders in world football since joining Liverpool FC in January 2018 and is now club captain. The powerful Netherlands international, who combines a graceful reading of the game with a dominant physical skillset, has helped the Reds lift a host of the biggest trophies available to date. He played every single minute of the 2019-20 Premier League campaign as Liverpool gloriously and emphatically ended their wait for the title with a club-record 99 points. A constantly imposing presence in the back line, Van Dijk also weighed in with five goals, including a vital double against Brighton & Hove Albion and the opener past Manchester United at Anfield. The historic season also saw the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup added to the trophy cabinet – the latter for the first time. The No.4 had previously been a key figure as the Reds clinched a sixth European Cup at the conclusion of his first full season with the club. Victory over Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid secured the first piece of silverware at Liverpool for Van Dijk, who also missed just 35 minutes of Premier League action in 2018-19 as Jürgen Klopp's side finished second with 97 points.He was an outstanding presence at the heart of the defence as the Reds eliminated Bayern Munich – against whom he scored in a crucial second-leg win in Germany – as well as FC Porto and FC Barcelona on the road to a second successive Champions League final. And there was redemption in the showpiece as Van Dijk and co bounced back from their defeat by Real Madrid a year earlier to see off Spurs 2-0 and lift the trophy at Estadio Metropolitano. Such was the Dutchman's imperious form throughout the campaign, he was voted PFA Players' Player of the Year by his peers and also collected the Premier League Player of the Season award. The centre-back had served notice of his potential for consistency at the highest level during his opening half-season with the Reds, which began with a winner past Everton at Anfield and ended with that loss against Real in Kyiv. Van Dijk had previously built his reputation in the Premier League with Southampton following spells at Willem II, FC Groningen and Celtic. In the opening weeks of the 2020-21 campaign, he sustained a serious knee ligament injury against Everton that required surgery and then rehabilitation for the remainder of the season. But the defender returned in commanding fashion for 2021-22, signing a new long-term contract and then featuring in 51 of Liverpool's 63 matches in all competitions as they added the Carabao Cup and FA Cup to their trophy haul while also finishing runners-up in the Premier League and Champions League. Van Dijk's outstanding personal form was acknowledged by his inclusion in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and subsequent nomination for the 2022 Ballon d'Or, an award for which he was voted second place three years earlier. Following the departure of Jordan Henderson in July 2023, Netherlands skipper Van Dijk was officially announced as the Reds' new captain. More silverware marked his first campaign with the armband, the No.4 heading in the winning goal when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the 2024 Carabao Cup final. And towards the end of the 2024-25 season, during which he reached a triple-century of appearances for the club, Van Dijk committed his future by putting pen to paper on a new deal."

    bio: "A classy defender who can play anywhere across the backline, Joe Gomez has overcome serious injury setbacks to win a series of major honours with Liverpool FC. Signed as an 18-year-old from Charlton Athletic in the summer of 2015, he has since featured for the Reds at centre-back, right-back and left-back. Handed his senior debut on the opening day of 2015-16, Gomez sustained a serious knee injury while on international duty with England U21s shortly after Jürgen Klopp's appointment as manager in October 2015. After a 17-month spell on the sidelines, Gomez returned to action in January 2017 and then made 31 appearances in 2017-18 as Liverpool reached the Champions League final. An outstanding start to 2018-19 was rewarded with a new contract in December 2018, although his progress had been halted by a lower-leg fracture sustained a week before he put pen to paper. Gomez returned to fitness in April 2019 and featured in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of the Champions League as Liverpool went one better than 12 months earlier by beating Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid. The England international settled into the heart of Klopp's defence in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 campaigns, forming a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk as Liverpool claimed four major trophies across the two seasons. Gomez played 43 times in all competitions in 2019-20 – his highest number of appearances in a campaign since his arrival at Anfield – to help the Reds emphatically end their wait for a Premier League title with a club-record 99 points. In the early stages of the 2020-21 season, he sustained a knee injury while on duty with England during the November international break. The issue required surgery and ruled Gomez out for the remainder of the term. He returned once again the following year, featuring on 21 occasions as Liverpool lifted the Carabao Cup and Emirates FA Cup, narrowly missed out on the championship and reached another Champions League final. Ahead of the 2022-23 campaign Gomez further extended his spell on Merseyside by signing a new long-term contract and also switched to shirt No.2 from his previous No.12. The defender was a fixture for the Reds in 2023-24, playing 51 times in a variety of roles – including midfield – and adding another Carabao Cup winner's medal to his haul."

    bio:"Centre-back Ibrahima Konate bolstered Liverpool FC's defensive ranks when he joined the club ahead of the 2021-22 season. The France international agreed a move to the Reds from RB Leipzig after four seasons with the Bundesliga side in which he played almost a century of games in domestic and European competition. Konate's first steps in football came with Paris FC before he joined the academy of FC Sochaux in 2014 and switched from an aspiring striker to the middle of defence. He progressed through the ranks at Sochaux and made his professional debut in January 2017, which was followed by a run of Ligue 2 appearances in the second half of that 2016-17 season. Konate's promising performances quickly caught the attention of Leipzig and they swooped to sign the defender on a free transfer that summer. Ibrahima went on to play 95 times for Leipzig in all competitions, with almost half of that tally coming during a standout 2018-19 campaign. With Konate a consistent figure, Die Roten Bullen finished third in the Bundesliga – boasting the division's best defensive record – and were runners-up in the German cup. He also gained Champions League experience with eight runouts in the tournament before the Reds finalised a deal to bring him to Anfield. The No.5 made an impressive start to life on Merseyside, claiming 29 appearances during a remarkable debut 2021-22 campaign that saw Jürgen Klopp's team launch a bid for a stunning quadruple. After featuring as a substitute and scoring a penalty in the Carabao Cup final shootout victory over Chelsea, Konate started the FA Cup showpiece against the same opponents – having netted in the last-four success versus Manchester City – as Liverpool completed a domestic double at Wembley. The centre-back, a firm fan favourite at Anfield, also earned a place in the XI for the Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid, with his individual form leading to a first senior France call-up. And his progress continued as he made five appearances to help Les Bleus reach the 2022 World Cup final, where they lost on penalties to Argentina. Konate featured 37 times in 2023-24 for the Reds – his highest total yet – including a start versus Chelsea at Wembley when the Carabao Cup was lifted again."

The Greece international made the move to Merseyside after 86 appearances in all competitions for Olympiacos, with whom he won the domestic title in 2019-20. It was a breakthrough year for the defender, including 46 games – 12 in the Champions League – as his side reclaimed the Greek Super League. Tsimikas had made his debut for Olympiacos in December 2015 and later enjoyed productive loan spells with Esbjerg in Denmark and Willem II in the Netherlands before establishing himself in their first team. After representing his country at U19 and U21 level, he also earned a first senior cap for Greece in October 2018. That development caught the attention of the newly crowned Premier League champions and the Reds sealed a deal to bring Tsimikas in ahead of the 2020-21 campaign. He made his Liverpool debut in a Carabao Cup tie at Lincoln City in September 2020, while his Champions League bow for the club came off the bench away to Atalanta in November of that same year. During a first season at Anfield hindered by injury and COVID-19, Kostas' first Premier League appearance arrived as a substitute against Manchester City in February 2021. The 'Greek Scouser' began to truly make his mark in 2021-22, featuring on 26 occasions as the Reds played 63 games and launched a bid for a quadruple. Indeed, Tsimikas earned a place in the club's history when he converted the winning penalty in a shootout against Chelsea as the FA Cup was lifted at Wembley in May 2022, adding to the Carabao Cup success earlier in the campaign. He then committed his future to Liverpool again by signing a new long-term contract at Anfield in September 2023, and gained another League Cup winner's medal that season."

Now firmly established as one of the world's premier full-backs, Robertson was still playing part-time for Queen's Park in his native Glasgow as recently as 2013. During his first two seasons with Liverpool - following a transfer from Hull City in the summer of 2017 - Robertson progressed from squad player to key component in a team that followed up reaching the European Cup final in 2018 by winning the tournament while posting a remarkable 97-point domestic season a year later. Then, in 2019-20, he was again crucial as Jürgen Klopp's side added three more major trophies to their collection: the UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and, of course, the Premier League. An indefatigable source of quality, energy and industry on the left flank, Robertson - who was appointed Scotland skipper in September 2018 - missed just five of the Reds' 97 Premier League and Champions League matches across both 2018-19 and 2019-20. And his status as a creative force for Liverpool is underlined by the fact he registered a combined total of 23 Premier League assists in 2018-19 and 2019-20, before then making history by becoming the division's highest-assisting defender in December 2022. Robertson's journey to the pinnacle of English, European and world club football saw him join Dundee United from Queen's Park, before his first taste of Premier League football came with Hull in 2014-15. His consistency continued when he tallied a further 50 appearances for the Reds in 2020-21 as a third-placed finish and Champions League qualification was secured. Having signed a new long-term contract with the club in August 2021, Robertson added more medals to his collection during his fifth season at the club. Klopp's squad played out a 63-game campaign - of which Robertson appeared in 47 - that saw them claim Carabao Cup and FA Cup glory at Wembley. 'Robbo' is now on the brink of 300 Liverpool appearances, having helped secure the second League Cup triumph of his spell during 2023-24."

Frimpong racked up 190 appearances, scored 30 goals and had 44 assists from operating in defensive and attacking positions for Die Werkself. He made the move to Leverkusen from Celtic in January 2021 and would go on to establish himself as a standout talent, earning spots in the Bundesliga Team of the Season in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Frimpong made 47 appearances in all competitions when Leverkusen won the league and DFB-Pokal in 2023-24 during their European-record run of 51 consecutive matches unbeaten. His debut for the Dutch national team – an appearance off the bench in a European Championship qualifier against France – was earned in the October of that campaign. Frimpong also collected major honours during his year-and-a-half stint at Celtic by lifting the Scottish Premiership, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup in 2019-20.

Frimpong's debut at senior level came with the Hoops on September 26, 2019, when he produced a Player of the Match display in a cup tie with Partick Thistle.

The Hungary captain made the switch to Anfield after two-and-a-half years in the Bundesliga at Leipzig, with whom he lifted the DFB-Pokal twice. A versatile, attack-minded midfielder, Szoboszlai departed Germany having made 91 appearances for Die Roten Bullen in all competitions, scoring 20 goals and providing 22 assists along the way. He hit the ground running following his arrival on Merseyside and was named Standard Chartered Player of the Month for August. The No.8 opened his goalscoring account for the club in stunning fashion in September with a long-range hit that put Liverpool on their way to a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa at Anfield. Szoboszlai was on the scoresheet seven times from 45 appearances in his debut season, including a Goal of the Month winner for a powerful drive against Leicester City. He claimed a Carabao Cup winner's medal for playing a part in Liverpool's journey to Wembley, though ultimately missed the final with Chelsea due to injury.  Born in Szekesfehervar, Szoboszlai began his football journey in his home country and then emerged through the youth ranks at Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg, making his fledgling steps in the professional game with their sister team, Liefering. After 10 goals in 33 games during his maiden campaign, Dominik stepped up to senior level with Salzburg and featured regularly as they achieved league and cup doubles in 2018-19 and 2019-20. Indeed, the midfielder's performances saw him named Austrian Bundesliga Player of the Season for 2019-20 and saw him attract the attention of Leipzig; a move was duly completed in January 2021. An untimely adductor injury prevented Szoboszlai from debuting for Leipzig until the start of the next term, and from representing Hungary at Euro 2020, though his ascendancy soon continued.

    bio:"World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister arrived at Liverpool FC in the summer of 2023 from Brighton & Hove Albion. The midfielder claimed the No.10 shirt upon his arrival to Anfield, occupying the squad number last taken by Sadio Mane after signing a long-term deal. The Argentina international, who was a key figure in his nation's success at the 2022 World Cup, slotted in seamlessly in his first season on Merseyside. He ended it with 46 appearances in all competitions, 14 goal contributions (seven goals, seven assists) and a Carabao Cup winner's medal. Mac Allister would make his debut on the opening day of 2023-24 away at Chelsea and then opened his goalscoring account with a stunning strike against Fulham that was later nominated for Premier League Goal of the Season. His levels rose as the campaign went on, sealing April's Standard Chartered Player of the Month award, as he helped Liverpool secure Champions League qualification with a third-place finish in the Premier League. Born into a footballing family in Santa Rosa, Alexis' father Carlos was a player himself and teammate of Diego Maradona at Boca Juniors and with the national team. Alexis' older brothers Francis and Kevin are also professionals. Mac Allister's own journey in the game began at the prestigious Club Social Parque academy, which counts Maradona, Carlos Tevez and plenty of other Argentina internationals among its alumni. From there, he joined Argentinos Juniors, where he would progress to the first team and make a senior debut in October 2016, helping them secure promotion to the Argentinian top flight in the same season. Brighton came calling at the start of 2019 and he would return to Juniors on loan after completing his transfer to the Seagulls. Having joined Boca Juniors for a temporary spell, a debut for Argentina soon followed, when he appeared as a second-half substitute in a friendly with Chile in September 2019. Mac Allister made 20 appearances for Boca before that loan was cut short and he was recalled to kickstart his Brighton career. He would fully establish himself on the south coast in 2021-22, during which he made 33 Premier League appearances and was on the scoresheet on five occasions. His rise for club and country continued the following season. Mac Allister started all but one of Argentina's fixtures at the World Cup, scoring against Poland and then laying on an assist in the victory over France in the memorable final.  Returning to England with that winner's medal, he then helped Brighton secure European football for the first time in their history with a sixth-placed finish in the league. With 35 outings and 12 goal involvements, he was nominated for Premier League Young Player of the Season. That development would attract the interest of Liverpool, who moved quickly to make him their first recruit of the 2023 summer transfer window."

    bio:"Curtis Jones is a versatile and talented midfield player who has progressed from Liverpool FC's Academy to the senior team. The Scouser has been with the club since U9 level and is now firmly established in the senior set-up. He signed a new long-term contract in November 2022. Jones realised a lifelong ambition by making his Reds debut in January 2019, in an FA Cup third-round tie against Wolverhampton Wanderers. A year later, at the same stage of the same competition, he scored his first senior goal in unforgettable fashion, curling in a stunning winner to beat Everton at Anfield. The following round of the FA Cup saw him make history when he became the club's youngest ever captain at the age of 19 years and five days in the replay victory over Shrewsbury Town. Jones earned a Premier League winner's medal for playing his part in the Reds' 2019-20 triumph and, in July 2020, his progress was rewarded as he signed a new long-term deal. A day later, he netted his first Premier League goal in a 2-0 win against Aston Villa at Anfield. Jones was named Premier League 2 Player of the Season for his performances for the U23s throughout 2019-20 and he then permanently stepped up to the senior squad for the following campaign. Thirty-four appearances followed in 2020-21, before Jones made a further 27 – despite being hampered by an eye injury – in 2021-22 to help Liverpool win the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, and finish runners-up in both the Premier League and Champions League. Injury restricted his availability for parts of the next campaign, too, but the No.17 ended the season as a fixture in the XI and netted a classy brace away at Leicester City. Jones then went on to star at the 2023 U21 European Championship, claiming the winning goal in the final and being named in the Team of the Tournament as England lifted the trophy. He took more strides in 2023-24, racking up his highest number of appearances (36 in all competitions) and goals (five), and ended it being named in England's provisional squad for Euro 2024."

The versatile, attack-minded Elliott moved to the club after a breakthrough season with Fulham in which he made three senior appearances for the Cottagers. That included a record-breaking Premier League debut at the age of 16 years and 30 days when he came on as a substitute against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Elliott made his Liverpool debut by starting the League Cup tie at MK Dons in September 2019. His Premier League bow arrived as a substitute against Sheffield United at Anfield in January 2020. He signed his first professional contract in July 2020 and his progress has since been rewarded with fresh long-term deals in the successive summers of 2021 and 2022. Elliott spent the 2020-21 season on loan at Blackburn Rovers, scoring seven times and registering 11 assists during an impressive campaign in the Championship. After subsequently breaking into the Reds' senior team in the early weeks of 2021-22, the midfielder suffered a significant setback with a serious ankle injury sustained at Elland Road. However, he returned to action in February 2022 and helped Liverpool win the Carabao Cup and Emirates FA Cup as they competed for a quadruple. An England U21 international, Elliott made his 50th appearance for the club in January 2023 and then helped the Young Lions lift that summer's European Championship. Elliott was a much-relied-upon figure in the 2023-24 season as he appeared 53 times in all competitions – taking his overall tally into triple figures – and added another Carabao Cup winner's medal to his collection."

He made his Liverpool debut just a day after arriving when he came on in the second half of a 3-1 victory over AFC Bournemouth at Anfield. Endo then opened his Reds account with a goal in a Europa League win over Toulouse in the October. After his settling-in period, he went on to produce outstanding form that saw him voted Standard Chartered Player of the Month for December. Endo finished his first campaign on Merseyside with 43 appearances to his name and a Carabao Cup winner's medal, having played all of the dramatic final with Chelsea at Wembley.  Born in Yokohama, his first taste of professional football came with Shonan Bellmare, who he helped clinch Japan's second-division title in 2014. He would then make the move to Urawa Red Diamonds, where he caught the attention of teams in Europe and later signed for Belgian Pro League side Sint-Truiden VV in 2018. Endo spent just one full season in Belgium before he was on the move again. He initially headed to Stuttgart on a loan in 2019 that would eventually become a permanent switch after impressing during the team's promotion from 2. Bundesliga. As his importance to Stuttgart grew on and off the pitch, he was installed as club captain ahead of the 2021-22 season. He went on to cement himself in the club's folklore with a 92nd-minute winner over FC Köln that secured his side's status in the German top flight. Making 99 outings in the Bundesliga, Endo topped the league for challenges won for two consecutive seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22) and finished fourth in those rankings during his final campaign in the division.

The Netherlands international became the Reds' fourth new recruit of that summer by signing a long-term deal. He made his debut for the club as a late substitute in the Premier League win at Wolverhampton Wanderers before netting his first goal in a Europa League meeting with Union SG a month after arriving. The No.38, who made 38 appearances and scored four times during his debut campaign at Anfield, earned a 2024 Carabao Cup winner's medal, having started the Wembley final against Chelsea. Taking his earliest steps in the game as a youngster at AVV Zeeburgia, Gravenberch joined the esteemed academy of his boyhood club, AFC Ajax, aged eight. Prodigious ability carried him through the ranks quickly; so much so, in fact, that he was given a senior debut for the Dutch giants as a 16-year-old in September 2018. That outing made Gravenberch the youngest debutant in Ajax's illustrious history, and three days later he became their youngest goalscorer in the professional era too. His development took a true forward leap in 2020-21 as he became a mainstay in the XI and helped the Amsterdammers romp to the Eredivisie title and lift the Dutch cup, in which he provided the opening goal in the final. Ryan was awarded the league's Talent of the Year accolade following that campaign and then was part of the Ajax squad that retained the championship in 2021-22.

    bio:"Liverpool won the race to sign one of Europe's most exciting forwards when Hugo Ekitike joined the club in the summer of 2025. The sought-after French attacker arrived as a new option for Arne Slot's reigning Premier League champions, agreeing a long-term contract to seal a transfer from Eintracht Frankfurt. Born in Reims, he started out in football with nearby Cormontreuil FC before signing for the academy of his hometown club in 2013. Ekitike's abilities stood him out as a notable talent during his advancement up through the age groups of Stade de Reims, and he was awarded a first professional contract in the summer of 2020. His senior debut for the club came in October of the same year, before a loan move to Danish Superliga side Vejle Boldklub was arranged for the second half of the 2021-22 campaign. Ekitike successfully broke into the XI there and contributed three goals and two assists from 11 appearances to set himself up for a return to Reims that would see his development take a big leap. The 6ft3in centre-forward featured in 26 league and cup matches for Reims in 2021-22, supplying 11 goals and four assists to stir significant interest from around the continent in recruiting him. Paris Saint-Germain proved to be his next destination, Ekitike moving to the capital – initially on loan – to form part of a squad already boasting attacking riches such as Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar. Despite that level of competition, Hugo made 14 starts and 18 substitute appearances for PSG in 2022-23 and had his first taste of Champions League football. The season ended with him lifting a league title, too, having contributed to his team's championship glory in Ligue 1, edging out Lens to top the table by a single point. Ekitike's move to Paris was made permanent in the summer of 2023 but he found game time limited with PSG thereafter. It's an experience he believes was key in shaping his mentality. 'Obviously in terms of longevity, I'm not going to say that my time in Paris was the happiest moment of my life,' he once explained. 'But when I look back, I say to myself that maybe it was necessary.' A loan move to Eintracht at the beginning of 2024 offered Ekitike a new avenue for progress – and, to extend the metaphor, he sprinted along it. Four goals and two assists in the Bundesliga during his temporary stint convinced Frankfurt of his potential and the switch became permanent ahead of 2024-25. That campaign saw Ekitike become one of the most prolific and creative players in Germany's top flight, 33 appearances including 15 goals and eight assists to help his team to a third-placed finish and earn him a spot in the division's Team of the Season. He added seven more strikes in the cup and Europa League, where Eintracht enjoyed a run to the quarter-finals before a narrow elimination to eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur. A host of European clubs were now again circling to recruit Hugo and it was new Premier League champions Liverpool who secured his signature in time for 2025-26."

A gifted attacking midfielder equally comfortably in scoring goals and supplying them, he advanced through the youth ranks during a decade at Cologne before switching to Bayer Leverkusen at the beginning of 2020 and truly beginning his ascendancy. Wirtz debuted for Leverkusen just a fortnight after his 17th birthday in May of that year and within a few more weeks had opened his Bundesliga scoring account – a goal against Bayern Munich making him the youngest player ever to net in the division at the time. He was swiftly integrated into the senior set-up, making 69 appearances in all competitions for Leverkusen in the two seasons that followed – which included 18 goals. The speed of his progress was reflected by the fact of becoming the youngest player to tally 50 matches in the Bundesliga. In between times, Wirtz was part of Germany’s winning squad at the U21 European Championship in 2021, providing both goals in the semi-final success over the Netherlands and starting the showpiece victory against Portugal. An anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in March 2022 temporarily halted his rapid development, however, and ruled Wirtz out of action until the following January. But he returned better than ever and 2023-24 would prove to be a watershed and historic season for the player himself and Leverkusen collectively. Under the stewardship of former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso, the man from Pulheim was a leading figure in a scarcely believable campaign that saw Bayer navigate the whole German top-flight season without losing a game. In fact, they were only defeated once in 53 fixtures overall, completing a double by lifting the German cup and narrowly missing out on a treble due to defeat by Atalanta in the Europa League final. Wirtz’s personal contributions to those achievements included 49 appearances and a remarkable 38 goal contributions – split between 18 strikes of his own and 20 assists for others. He was duly named Bundesliga Player of the Season having been instrumental in Leverkusen’s first German championship success since the club was founded in 1904. Still just 21, Wirtz then made five appearances for his country at Euro 2024 and scored twice, including a goal off the bench in their quarter-final exit versus eventual tournament winners Spain. By now, interest in extracting the attacker and many of his teammates from the Leverkusen squad was only increasing, though he remained at the club for the 2024-25 campaign. And Wirtz’s output continued to be eye-catchingly impressive, specifically 31 goal contributions (16 goals, 15 assists) from his 45 games, which included his first taste of Champions League football. He took to the latter like the proverbial duck to water, scoring six times in nine appearances and marking his debut in the competition with two goals in a 4-0 win at Feyenoord. Wirtz has now opted for a fresh challenge in the form of Premier League champions Liverpool, sealing a transfer to the Reds as they plot to build on the success of Arne Slot’s first year in charge."

Gakpo set out on his journey towards the professional game by trialling with PSV Eindhoven at the age of six, beginning a development that would see him blossom into a leading figure for club and country. Having progressed all the way through the Eredivisie side's youth ranks, a first chance to represent the team he supported as a boy at senior level arrived in February 2018 with a brief substitute appearance against Feyenoord in league action. The special moment of his maiden goal for PSV came later in the same year, with Gakpo opening the scoring in a 4-0 Dutch cup victory away at Excelsior Maassluis in the September. The attacker established himself as a regular member of the first-team squad across the remainder of the 2018-19 campaign, including 16 Eredivisie appearances. Cody's trajectory would then take a sharper upturn in the seasons that followed, with seven goals and seven assists during a 2019-20 league campaign that was curtailed in the Netherlands due to the COVID-19 pandemic.There were 11 strikes across all competitions in 2020-21, before a 2021-22 campaign that brought another surge forward in productivity as well as personal and collective success. Gakpo, a composed finisher off either foot, provided 12 goals and 13 assists in the Eredivisie and netted the winning goal as PSV recovered from a deficit to defeat AFC Ajax and lift the Dutch cup in April. His stellar form was subsequently acknowledged with the award of the country's Footballer of the Year honour – becoming the first player from the club to take the prize since former Red Georginio Wijnaldum in 2014-15. Cody had left his mark in European competitions, too, scoring seven times in 15 outings across Champions League qualifiers, the Europa League and Europa Conference League. That scintillating performance level continued and advanced into 2022-23, as he racked up both the most goals (nine) and assists (12) in the Eredivisie in 14 games before the pause for the World Cup. After making a first senior international appearance for the Netherlands at Euro 2020, he started all of his nation's five matches at the World Cup and impressed on the global stage as they reached the quarter-finals in Qatar. Gakpo was on the scoresheet in every group game at the tournament for the Dutch, converting a header past Senegal, thumping in a finish from 20 yards against Ecuador and sweeping home on the run versus the hosts.

The much-loved forward tragically died at the age of just 28 in a road traffic accident in July 2025, five years into a Reds career that was packed with special moments. Amid the huge outpouring of love for Jota, who passed away alongside his brother Andre Silva in the tragedy, the club confirmed the retirement of his jersey across all of its teams and for eternity. 'We will always carry him with us in our hearts, in our thoughts, wherever we go', said head coach Arne Slot. 'Maybe especially in difficult moments. But in any moment we are here, we will carry him with us in our thoughts and in our hearts.' The Portuguese had provided further Premier League-proven quality to the Liverpool squad after joining from Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2020. He had netted 16 goals in 67 top-flight outings in the previous two seasons as Wolves recorded successive seventh-placed finishes, plus nine Europa League strikes during a run to the quarter-finals in 2019-20. A hugely versatile attacker capable of featuring in any role of a front three and in wide midfield positions, Jota earned full international honours for Portugal, too, and opened his account for his country just weeks before signing for Liverpool. He originally switched to Wolves on loan from Atletico Madrid in 2017 and hit 17 goals that year to help fire them out of the Championship as league winners, before making the move to Molineux permanent and successfully transferring his talents to the Premier League. Having begun his career in his homeland with Pacos de Ferreira, Jota's rapid progress following a debut in 2014 had prompted Atletico to swoop for his services in 2016 – though he never actually appeared for the Spanish club. Instead, he spent 2016-17 on loan at FC Porto, scoring eight times in the Primeira Liga and gaining Champions League experience. By 2020, with Liverpool aiming to follow up their Premier League and European Cup triumphs of the previous two campaigns, manager Jürgen Klopp had identified Jota as a natural fit for his squad. Jota wasted no time in showcasing his talents at his new club, reaching double figures in goals after just 21 appearances despite his debut season being interrupted by a knee injury sustained in December that ruled him out for around three months. His progress accelerated again in 2021-22, the forward plundering 21 goals in all competitions and playing a key role as the Reds lifted the FA Cup and Carabao Cup while narrowly missing out on the Premier League and Champions League. Then, ahead of the beginning of the next season, Jota extended his time with the club by penning a new long-term contract, before making his 100th appearance in March 2023. An instinctive finisher with a massive work-rate, he hit the net another 15 times during a 2023-24 campaign that was affected by several injuries, taking him past a half-century of goals for the club in all competitions. Jota went on to add a coveted Premier League medal to his collection during the next season, Slot's first as head coach, providing nine goal contributions from 26 appearances in the top flight. Once more, he was a man for a big moment, crucial equalisers versus Fulham and Nottingham Forest during the campaign preceding what proved to be the final goal of his life: a vital Kop-end winner in the Merseyside derby. 'It is a remarkable achievement for a small guy that came from Gondomar, where I had this dream,' Jota said of winning England's title. 'To arrive at this moment was outstanding.' UEFA Nations League glory with Portugal followed his domestic joy for the Reds, and so too did marriage to long-term partner Rute, with whom he had three children. The sudden and tragic passing of Diogo and his brother Andre, in Spain on July 3, 2025, devastated all connected to Liverpool FC and prompted an enormous number of tributes on Merseyside and across the world. As his own supporter chant referenced so often, his name was Diogo and he took us to victory. He will always be our number 20."
